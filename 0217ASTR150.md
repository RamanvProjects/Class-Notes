## Giant Planets : Dead Worlds and Rings

-> Sections: Wed - Start Reflectance Spectroscopy
(Make bash script to automate this)

##### Ancient rocks show life could have flourished on Earth 3.2 Byrs (Rando pantso headline)

- Biological entities were fixing nitrogen in early Earth
- Essential to life on Earth
- Astronomy major

##### Start of Lecture

- Main giant planet satellites and characteristics
- _Roche Limit_ What is it?
- "Dead Worlds" of the Outer Solar System:
    + Callisto (Jupiter's satellite) and others
    + How do their surfaces compare to the surface of the Earth's Moon?

##### Giant Planet Satellites:

1. Rings
2. Regular Satellites (Natural vs Artificial (man-made))
3. Irregular Satellites

_Remind: Snow Line, sits about 3 AU from the Sun, inside the snow line, ices cannot condense. After 3 AU, there's a basic change in the composition of the planets, higher degree of volatiles. Ices dominate, outside the snow-line_

- Biased towards solid words

#### Irregular Satellites:

- Size
    + Small (asteroid size), high Albedos
- Formation
    + Capture
- Orbits
    + Prograde and retrogade (retro, opposite orbit)
    + High eccentricity
    + High Inclination
    + Far from the planet
- Composition & others  Primarily ice (far outside of the Snow Line)
- Heavily cratered
- Ancient

_"Size determines shape"_

-> Drage columns
Irregular satellites have weird orbits

#### Regular Satellites

- Size  Large (Earth's moon size or larger)
- Formation 
    + Co-Accretion (not like the moon)
- Orbits
    + Prograde and Synchronous (same side faces planet)
    + Low eccentricity - nearly circular
    + Low inclination - orbit directly above the planet's equator
    + Close to the planet
- Composition
    + Ice & Rock (formed outside the snow line)
    + Some (not all) are heavily cratered

-> Galilean Satellites of Jupiter's

- Reg satellites of low inclination, prograde, low eccentricity

##### Ring Properties

- Size
    + Very small (cm to m in diameter)
- Formation
    + Varies
- Orbits
    + ProgradeVery low eccentricity very low inclination (equator)
    + Close to the planet (very close)

#### Why do Giant Planets have Rings

- (Make a fraction) F_gravity = Mm/d^2
- Objects spread out inside the Roche limit, which is why they are close, limits accretion. Low inclination because of accretion disk not clumpin
- Roche limit is about 2.5 R<sub>planet</sub>(subscript markdown)
- Rings are satellites that could not form
- Huygens: First to surmise that the lump on Saturn was a ring, not a solid ring
- For a solid object, small perturbations are devastating
- Saturn's rings are mostly water-ice (matched with reflectance spectroscopy)
- Particles are so small that they can not be resolved, most are very small ice particles
- Albedo high 0.6
- Ring thickness is very low, 10-100 meters, cool Cassini picture
- Markdown particlesTotal ring mass is about the size of a 200 km asteroid, Cassini Huygens
- Ring particles are in resonance with satellites outside of the Roche Limit. Dozens of satellites yield a complicated ring structure
- Mimas?
- Satellites dictate the structure of rings, moons in the rings can influence the rings, can see gravitational wake
- Shepherd moons
- Very young exoplanet, 16 myrs. 

## Large Life system.create

- Do readings

###### Readings, Uranus, small rings, dynamics are the same, etc.

- Particle albedo in Uranus' rings, low. Because organics
- Scaled down version of Saturn, 4 km asteroid
- Neptune's have to be looked at in different wavelengths
- Ring mass lower
- Voyager discovered a freaking small ring near Jupiter. One band.
- A smooth belt of material? 10<sup>--3</sup>, size of dust or smoke particles. Tiny
- Looks at it in infrared
- Satellites outside of the Roche Limit block debris. Creates tiny objects that spiral into Jupiter, like a mini Solar System, Jupiter is very hot, Saturn wasn't as hot, B.T now
- Callisto is 1.86 g/cm3 , low albedo 0.3
- Callisto's surface has been unchanged since the beginning of the solar system
- World in the outer solar system are crater saturated.
- The same mechanism for craters applies
- Callisto, huge impact basin, VALHALLA
- Outermost wave 2600 km in diameter, melted basin

##### Callisto's age

- Crater saturation means that previous craters have been covered up by new craters.
- How can we get an accurate N(10) value?
- Doesn't even matter, R-Plots don't match, can't determine age with N(10)
- Depends on comparison to the moon, can't be done in the outer solar system
- Age estimates are ancient, 4.5 Byrs, look like highlands?
- ASGARD (sold) and dark terrain (dotted) spectra
- Water Ice

##### Mimas

- Satellite of Saturn only, 500 km in diameter 0 heavily cratered, ancient surface, Crater Herschel
- The cratering population is very different.
- Images, looks like the death star AstronomyMimas wobbles as it orbits satur, libration
- Indicates that the interior is differentiated but not uniform, core may be oval shaped or have an abnormal amount of mass located beneath crater Herschel
- Mimas has a weird temperature profile. (search only line)
- Strange mass distribution
- Old age estimate only, can't count

##### Rhea

- Low density, icy, high albedo
- Rhea may have a tenuous ringRhea may have been geologically active
- All surfaces are similar to each other, Hyperion

##### Iapetus

- Pretty much all ice, 0.6 0.2 split
- On leading side of satellite
- Iapetus has a huge mountain range that runs along the equator of the plan, 25km high
- The result of re-accretion of material the fell back on to satellite from giant impact.
- Has a bunch of carbonaceous chondrites
- Phoebe is a carbonaceous chondrite baterial, plasters Iapetus as it breaks apart
- Phoebe causes a ring outside the Roche limit
- Oberon and Umbriel are totes the same, dead.
