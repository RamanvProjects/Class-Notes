##Week 4 Section 1 ASTR Notes (Venus), Remember to Upload Images. LaTeX note taking (Octave)

(No quiz next week)

#### Venus (The Surface Of):

How does the level and scale of geologic activity on Venus compare to the Moon and Mars?

How and why is the crater population on Venus different from the crater population on the Moon and Mars?

What does the crater population tell us about the history and age of the surface

##### Score Sheet:

- Differentiated world of iron and rock, albedo high (.59).
- **92 atmospheres!** About the same size as Earth.
- Rotation is retrograde. (873, 873)

_Venus is so interesting (find a way to apply dictionary to thing_

-> Venus' geologic activity is expected to have geologic activity similar to that of Earth's.

##### Locations:

- Venus is the second planet from the sun, Venus _transits_ the Sun (and can be seen as such)
- (Transits are for seeing other planets)
- Venus has phases :-)

##### Features:

- Clouds are completely opaque, can't see the surface.

##### Studies:

- Soviets land on Venus (better autocomplete for markdown)
- Called Venera. Just probes for data. Survived for short amounts of time.

###### Venera 4:

- Studied the atmosphere- found it was much hotter than expected. Top of the atmosphere is something like 200 degrees.
- Studied the brightness of the atmosphere - on the surface it's light enough to see (noon in Seattle in Winter) and rather clear.

###### Venera 9:

- First images (open cv image analysis laptop case). Looks like fresh lava flow. Sharp, un-weathered, fresh (young) rocks/ Basalt. 

###### Venera 10:

- Looks like a mare surface and samples

###### Venera 13:

- Could send back a color image. Looks yellowed.

###### Venera 14:

- Signs of wind, wind moves slow ~1 m/s, looks flat and empty.

-> All the spectra was consistent with Basalt. (Go to the scablands or Iceland?)

- Surface can only be detected through radar scanning. Radar tells you if it's smooth or rough verses actual brightness. Brighter = More Rough
- (Post apocalyptic novel)
- (better dictionary autocomplete suggestions

(Insert Moon, Mars, and Venus pic)

- Venus is pretty flat
- Venus has been mapping since 1994
- No highlands! Few impact craters and all of them are relatively large, but _no large impact basins_!
- (Astr major? All autocomplete)
- Instead of craters, we see "bumpy" volcanoes
- There are thousands of large volcanoes. All are shield volcanoes.
- Usually on Earth created by plate tectonics, but on Venus they look like hotspots
- Young shield volcanoes cover the surface - iceland, but expected as geologically active

###### Geology:

- Surface is heavily fractured - looks like strike/slip faults on Earth - folding & sliding on the surface. (Take geology or I&S better autocomplete)
- Baltis Vallis, longest channel in the solar system (Baltis Vallis)
- Surface winds aren't very strong, but create sand dunes. Very desert-y
- Surface is heavily fractured and has moved, especially near the equator, _evidence of techtonic activity_
- Large volcanoes and calderas everywhere (Sapas Mons same girth as Olympus Mons but much less tall (gravity and lisp))

##### Coronae

- Looks like large pancakes, rough areas in the mare.
- Very ubiquitous (lab) on Venus
- Coronae are not volcanoes though they are related to geologic activity
    + Surface around them is fractured.

###### Formation

1. Rise of mantle plume
2. Plume spreads and flattens
3. Plume cools and moat and a depression forms

Dubbed _blob techtonics_
