(Missed Last Week's Notes)

##The Planets (Week 2):

Remember (Monday Assignment, Quiz, Friday Summary, Sign up for class PSYCH 101?)

###Absolute Ages

Figuring out _Cumulative Crater Density_: (Eg. N(10))

Absolute Ages are determined from returned samples. Needs to be analyzed in lab. All ages are from returned samples.

--The moon is the only cratered world we have samples from. We will compare all other worlds to the Moon (Ancient Surface)

#####Today: The Moon - Apollo Missions (ASTR classes)

_Today's themes_: 

+ Why go to the moon?
+ Apollo landing sites - where did we land and why?
+ Samples?

**Why?**

    -To beat the Soviets
    -(1967 to 1970s Apollo)
    -Budget peaked at over 5% during the Space Race
    (Article: Soviet fires Earth Satellite into Space, Circling the globe)
    -Reports "I feel well" (Yuri Gagarin 1961)

+ "First I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal." (surround by underscores)
+ Two Geminis fly 6 to 10 feet apart in man's first apce rendezvous; crews, face to face, talk by radio, proved radio and computational tech
+ Werner Von Braun? Kind of meh
+ Every Russian attempt got unlucky. (this picture contains every human that has ever existed, besides Michael Collins)
+ Space program abruptly ended (ASTR 105-Exploring the Moon)

**Where and why?**

So, you wanna land on the moon?

--Keys:

+ Continue communications with the earth
+ Remember Moon is tidally locked, land on side facing earth
+ Stay close to the Lunar Equator (Staying in the Earth-Moon orbital plane uses less energy)
+ Near the center (Apollo 13? :-) ) 

(Copy class pic here, pics in mdown)

+ Done on a safe Mare Surface, soft and even (Planetary Geology, solar system speeds, etc)
    * All about the safety (quickly went and left)

**Samples?**

- Rock samples bring absolute ages from edge of craters, Mare surfaces (basalt)
- Gets an age around 3.5 billion.
- Rocks are about .5 billion from the beginning of the moon
- Vast majority of rocks are far younger
    + No longer exists on the surface of the Earth

**Crater Counting**

-- Count 10 kilometer craters or larger by age

Nov 19, 1969:

- Computing is better at landing in the right spot 
- Still landed on Mare surface
- (Lunar reconnaissance orbiter (done here))
- Age 3.2 (3.6 to 3.2)
- New N(10) Value (double check) and plotted

_Conclusion_: The moon was geologically active until about 3.2 - 1.2 billion years ago

Copernicus Crater Ray = Age, 1.8 Byrs 

##First Science Goal: Impact Basin 

- Imbrium Basin (When were they formed?) - Ancient impact area (split - screen)
- Land in area where some of the ejected material could be found (Mare had to flow after)
- Fra Mauro Formation, Ejected from Imbrium Basin
- Apollo 14 (1971):
    + Walked around Cone Crater in this region, find oldest rocks near crater rim, etc 1/10th blah blah blah
    + Went all around area, aged:

    3.8 BILLION YEARS OLD (memorize)

Rocks are primarily impact brecca. (new data points)

*Apollo 15:*

- Geologically interesting area (Highland region)
- They brought a rover (built in Kent? meh)
- Apollo 15,16, and 17 astronauts were the backup crews for Apollo 11, 12, and 13
- Crews decided to become field geologists
- Apollo 15, 16, and 17 looked for diverse sites and planned things out
    + Could package up rover

Landed on the rim of the Imbrium Basin:
+ Landed in mare between highlands
+ Drove 30 km during three 8 hour work days
+ Investigated and collected rocks from the rim and a nearby sinuous area (insert pic here)

- Age dated rock
    + Dated to 4.6 - 4.3 Byrs old, Rock type is pristine highland rock, (get lunar material) 
        * "Genesis Rock"
- The most ancient material on the surface of the moon (formed really low density)
- The crust is low density, meaning the moon is highly differentiated (because ancient low density material is on top)
- Million year age? (b.t... :-) )

(Insert pic of Apollo 16 Astronauts)

Apr 21 1972:
    
+ Thought they saw clay and volcanic material:
    * Apparently wrong?
+ Vulcanism is very rare, hoping to return volcaninc rocks. Found more pristine highland rock, all ancient rocks
+ Fit 4.4 byr absolute age from the rocks to the plot
+ Now we know what a 4.4 byr surface looks like
+ Learn about aging techniques

(impact basin 3.8 byrs)

Dec 11th, 1972:

+ Chose a geologically diverse areas, lava flows, sinuous ridges etc etc
+ They brought some person? <----Ternary operator
+ Brought a PhD geologist, Jack Schmidt (trained all previous astronauts). Went nuts. Still there to this day
+ (Find lectures previous)
+ Found cool samples

    Even the youngest rocks from the moon or older than pretty much everything on Earth
    The moon is an important ancient surface

#####The Result:

There was a period where the moon formed and a period of differentiation, the moon was well heated and K - ed (score card of the moon), moment of inertia is close to .4?

(Get class handouts)

- There was a period of lightly heavy bombardment 3.9 - 3.8 Byrs ago
- All of the impact basin ages are in that age. This must be a significant event in all the the terrestrial worlds.
- Maria is younger than the highland rock, Moon was geologically active 3.8 to 2.0 Byrs ago, then stopped.
- Cooling? Magic Cooling (radioactive materials decay and moon stops heating)
- Geologic activity declines as radioactive elements are converted to stable isotopes in the core of the world (Geologic activity scales with size)
- (Weathering?) No mare areas older than 2.0 billion years. Moon is geologically dead (weathering or impact)
- Hit the Big Chill phase

(Covered in lunar regolith, dusty planet)

##Five Stages of Planetary Evolution

1. Origin *Has heat source, and is hot*
2. Differentiation *Density shits*
3. Late Heavy Bombardment *Large impactors hitting worlds 3.8 byrs ago (all planets)*
4. Geologic Activity *Molten material makes its way to surface somehow*
5. The Big Chill *Core cools off*
