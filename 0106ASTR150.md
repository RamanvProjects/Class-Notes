###Key Questions

1. How do we know what we know about a  world?
    
    What is the world made of?
    What kind of terrain does it have?
    What processes shape the terrain?
    Does it have an atmosphere?
    What is the world's surface history?
    Why is there such a large variety of conditions and places in the Solar System?

###Cosmic Address

Earth, Solar System (19023 Virgo and Sloan sky survey), Milky Way, Local Group, Local SuperCluster

10 Gyrs > 1 Myrs > 1000 yrs

###The Times and Ages (B.t)

##The Solar System is Big and Empty (make a note taking plugin)

1 AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun

O --------------- 1 AU --------------- o

Terrestrial bodies are orders of magnitude closer to the Sun

#####Force of Gravity equations

Mass -> Size -> Volume -> Density etc...

**Gravity:** 

$$F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

**Density:**

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

Solids are planet-building materials (download and upload slide pic)
