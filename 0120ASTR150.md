#Mercury and Mars

--Review

- Orbital precession, obliquity -> Stabilized by the moon

#####The Surfaces of Mercury & Mars (History)

+ We are wandering through the Solar System from Worlds that are Geologically Simple to Geologically Complex


#####The Geologic History of Mercury and Mars

- How do we determine when geologic events happen on Mercury and Mars?
- How does the geologic history ... (Insert here)

#####Timescale

Differentiation -> Late heavy Bombardment -> Geological Activity -> Big Chill

- Lunar carter densities are calibrated from Apollo samples.
- The crater populations on the _Moon, Mercury, and Mars_ are similar
- (proportions of hits from various areas)

Conclusion: We can determine the absolte ages of the surfaces of both Mercury and Mars

-> We can _crater count_ the surfaces of both worlds and get an absolute age

####Mercury

Closes planet to the Sun. 0.4 AU
Hard to observe in the night sky

+ Doesn't get very high (insert scorecard here)
+ Half iron and half rock
+ Has a massive Iron Core
+ 0.34 K, Albedo 0.12 (low), 38% size of Earth
+ Surface temperature of 700 Day and -300 F night
+ (Death star size)
+ Mariner 10 orbits the Sun (still) and makes fly-bys of Mercury

Messenger -> Surface Geology

_Crater Density:_

- Distribution of cratering is similar to that of the moon's.
- Mercury has craters like the Moon: Simple, Complex, Large & Small
- Percentage of Mare is the same
- Mercury has crater-dominated highland surfaces (insert rest here)
Caloris Basin, Large impact basins like the moon (Caloris imbrium)

_Crater Counting:_

- Crater density. Mare regions are older (3.3 byrs)
- Crater count highland surfaces (old, studying)
- Summary: See periods of late heavy bombardment. Similar to that of the moon's

Water! -> Radar imaging. Blew out a piece of the Moon. Found water
Messenger -> Found polar frozen water on Mercury

Mercuries obliquity is nearly 0 degrees, some cold materials

The Albedo are very different. The chemical different between mercury and the moon makes differentiation difficult (surface albedo)

- Mercury has hilly terrain on the planet, the ripples of a giant impact (Caloris) makes ripples in the other side
- Scarps (Scrapy, pay), wrinkle and folding affect
    + Blame it on the core. Shrinking iron core pulls ripple in the outer crust

_The Lava flows on Mercury are huge (Larger than the Earth)_

-> Vulcanism is rare, comes through cracks, leaks onto planet

**Strange Hollows**

-- Oddly shaped dips surrounded by very bright material (insert here)

Large Impact Crater Embrandt (3.9 byrs)

Messenger has imed 30% maybe similar to mars

####Mars:

-- Yay Martians :-) Removed thing? j

- Higher albedo, varied terrain, not monochromatic
- Halfway between moon and Earth
- Big chilling, SA/V = 1 (Earth) -> Larger -> Cools faster (smaller, moon-like 3.7)

*Geologic Activity Scales with size*

- Mars too is geologically dead
- Distribution of mare and highland aren't uniform (impact basins blah)
- VolcanoS!!! 

##### Helis impact basin

+ Crater populations are similar (highland ages similar)
+ Northern Hemisphere, craters do not look like those on the Moon and Mercury, surrounded by raised features (raying?), impactors are hitting frozen areas, the ground heats and melts
+ First evidence of a surface rich in aa liqueid, much like permafrost, outflows are from mud that was heated on impact, flowed, refroze


Ages for mare about about 3.5 byrs (similar to others)

(Mare flowed)

-> Scablands :-)

- Evidence that water in a liquid state flowed across the surface of mars
- (Maybe life), Lot's of evidence

####Tharsis Region: Very "Young" Volcanoes (similar to Hawaii)

- Around 2 byrs (some younger to 0.5 byrs) complex life emerging on Earth hat this time (Cambrian)
- Some of the areas are as young as 100 myrs

###### Olympus Mons: The Larges volcano in the Solar System

Analogous to Mauno Kea, except huge.

*It's so big because gravity (basalt)*

- 25 km cube of basalt on Earth. Pressure at Base ~7500 atm
- Strength of Basalt ~2000 atm

Other reasons"

+ Plate tectonics: Limit size and hotspots
+ Geologic hotspots are stable on Mars, no plate tectonics
+ Mons is so big it fractured the land around it, Valley Marinaris (all volcanoes, huge)
+ Mars is far more complex than the moon, Water stuffs
