## Week 4 Section 2 Lecture notes

#### Terrestrial Atmospheres

##### Atmospheric Score Cards

- _Drastically different_: Mars' pressure is almost non-existent, Venus has a huge atmosphere.
- Each atmosphere as a basic composition with trace components.
- Mars and Venus are compositionally similar, with Earth being different (lacking in carbon dioxide)

##### Importance of temperature and mass:

- If a planet sits before the escape velocity, temperature graph, they cannot hold onto that gas. (Most planets cannot hold hydrogen and helium)


##### Primary vs Secondary atmosphere, Sources vs Sinks

- Primary:
    + Composed mostly of Hydrogen and helium, these comprise a planet's first (primary) atmosphere.
    + These two atoms are the most abundant/available at the time of a world's formation
    + A world has to have the "right" temperature (low) and gravity (large) to retain the primary atmosphere
    + The bulk majority of material in the solar system are hydrogen and helium
    + Gravity of small worlds, Gravity is too low, temp is too high. 

- Secondary Atmospheres:
    + Composed mostly of "heavy" atoms & molecules.
    + These comprise a planet second atmosphere. These atoms must have a _source_ to be plentiful in a world's atmosphere, world has to have the right temperature and or gravity to sustain it.

- Atmospheric sources: Outgassing (volcanoes), sublimation/evaporation (lakes and streams)
- Outgassing:
    + Gases released when a surface melts, the melting of a surface results from geologic processes (geologic activity) the surface and atmosphere are closely tied in secondary atmospheres
    + H20, CO2, SO2, N2, NE, AR, KR trace
    + This occurs when you melt rock

_Terrestrial atmospheres are wildly disparate between themselves and outgassing model._

##### Venus:

- Venus is geologically active and we know that there are lots of volcanoes, opaque atmosphere, close to the Sun. The surface is much hotter than expected
- Observed temperature of Venus is far higher than that of even Mercury
- Venusian atmosphere is primarily CO2 which efficiently absorvs infrared radiation
- Planetary atmospheres are good absorbers of infrared radiation
- Visible light can pass through our atmosphere, infrared cannot penetrate our atmosphere (BUT WHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!)
- Greenhouse gases absorb and scatter Infrared radiation. The dominant absorber is water vapor
- Basic idea (plebs):
    + Some of the infrared light is absorbed and re-emitted by the greenhouse gases, sunlight absorved by surface, Infrared light emitted by a warmed surface gets reflected back into the ground.

- The greenhouse effect regulates the earth's temperature to an appropriate place (warm :-) )

###### Venusian Greenhouse:

- Venus' greenhouse is magnified, it's atmosphere is predominantly CO2, and a lot of it
- Trapped infrared radiation is absorbed and scattered by by CO2 (why can the surface be seen!!!)
- Trapped infrared radiation is absorbed and scattered by CO2 as well as re-emmitted by the surface, heating a surface of rocks releases more CO2.
- A sink for SO2 requires a strong interaction between the atmosphere and the surface? (atmospheres)


##### Atmospheric Sinks:

- How to lose a terrestrial atmosphere
- List:
    + Thermal escape
    + Condensation
    + Chemical reactions with surface materials
    + Solar wind stripping

_The D/H ration is a telltale sign of an atmosphere influenced by ionization and radiation UV_

- The dissociation of water, photons dissociate hydrogen and oxygen, hydrogen leaves the planet. All the water in the Venus' atmosphere gets ditched

##### D/H ratio:

- Evidence of past water in Venus' atmosphere!
- Dissociation of water allows H to escape (no ozone)
- Deuterium is heavier, thus stays around longer. Venus has the same amount as Earth.
- Partial proof for water
- Venus does not have plate tectonics because apparently water is important.

###### Venus has no efficient way to lose heat. 

- No plate tectonics, hot atmosphere, hot core
- Processes occurring in our weather allow for sinks for different materials (review slides)

_ Venus has sulfuric acid droplets and a weak surface wind! _

##### HAVOC

- About 30-40 miles above the surface may exist the most Earth-like atmosphere in the Solar System, in the clear air layers their temperatures and pressures are Earth-like.
- Blimp fueled with helium :) and have a crew!

##### ESA Venus Express

- Launched in 2005, concluded 2014 December (propellant) to find information on Venus
- Frigid inversion layer exists at an altitude of 125 km where temperatures hover around -175 degrees C, temperature below the freezing point of CO2 possibly forming clouds of CO2 of ice or snow (frozen clouds yay)
- Venus wind speeds: 
    + At surface wind speeds are slow. Winds at the top of the atompshere called super rotation are 50x faster than the planet's rotation. Venus express found wind speeds increasing in just 6 years
    + (Astro major)

###### Polar Vortex: Hot air from equator rises and spirals toward the poles, they go from circular to boxlike

##### Earth:

- The Earth is geologically active, atomsphere reacts with surface, has ozone, blah blah blah (inset graph here)
- Earth has a carbon dioxide sink such that it's pulled from the atmosphere by it's surface (mostly condensation)

###### Weathering: The rocks take carbon dioxide off of the atmosphere of the planet and locks it in the rocks (surface)

- Venus' volcanoes aren't dead (added sulfur dioxide)
- Weathering: CO2 eventually gets into limestone, there's a net loss of carbon dioxide, 10,000 drop in CO2 levels
- CO2 has both organic and inorganic sinks on Earth, Plankton and Plants. Coral take in CO2 and make O2 (limestone to O2)
- Algae mats :)
- Earth also has O2 but this wasn't always the case. O2 is highly reactive so it can't stay in the atmosphere. Life produces it, takes a while.
- Lots of O2 reacted with metals initially, O2 needs a constant SOURCE. (Plant life)
- Life creates Ozone (O3). Without Ozone, water dissociates leaving a Venusian atmosphere behind
- Industrial revolution- taking CO2 out of geology and returning it to the atmosphere (better autocomplete), reversing affects at a much faster timescale. (A little greenhouse is good)

#### Mars:

- Geologically dead, 1.5 AU from the Sun, thin atmosphere, had water in the ancient past, about half the size of Venus and Earth
- Martian atmosphere is 1/600th of the Earth's atmosphere
- Mars has heavy weather. Clouds obscure the surface occasionally.
- Martian atmospheric composition is very Venus-like
- Mars has polar ice caps like Earth.
- Mars' polar ice caps are dynamic! Has a north polar caps
- Viking II landed near the North Pole. Found that the Martian atmospheric pressure varies by 50% throughout the season
- Mass of poles change over seasons. MRO, seasonal deposition of ice. The atmosphere of Mars comes from it's poles, melting adds to this.
- This freeze/thaw cycle creates the Mars' atmosphere- it is frozen some months, thawed on others.
- There's a huge (100 F) variation on Mars between nighttime and daytime temperatures. True across the planet
- Martian atmosphere is very rarefied (thin), it takes very little energy to change its temperature
- 72 watt lightbulb:
    + Venus 72 minutes
    + Earth 2 minutes
    + Mars 1 second
- When the atmosphere is thin, it has very little thermal inertia. (forgot the exact term)

###### Dust Storms: A global phenomenon, dust storms span the entire planet.

_Southern Spring- Atmosphere is evaporating off of South Polar cap_

- These observations imply that many rocks at the _Pathfinder_ are similar
- Global deposition of soil or dust on on Martial rocks are chemically the same
- Mars has dust devils
- Solar panels get coated
- Spirit Dust Devil Cleaning :-) by guiding the rover into a dust devils
- Dust devils are the size of the Himalayas (tornadoes)

**Conclusion: Liquid surface water in the past iplies that Mars' atmosphere was thicker and warmer in the past, no efficient sink. One of it's sinks is it's size, interactions with sun, Mars interacts with the Asteroid Belt! Impacts drive off the remaining atmosphere. Mars has no Ozone, no source for it, allows solar stripping**
