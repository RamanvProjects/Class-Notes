##Week 2: Astronomy Notes (1/15)

Reading summaries due Friday

Quiz 2 opens today at 11:30 am

--No Sections Monday Jan 19th - MLK day

###The Origin of the Moon

(Hint hint, China is sending missions to the moon)

+ *Why does Earth have a large natural satellite (the others do not)?*

+ *How do you make the Earth's Moon?*
    * What are the four main theories of Lunar Origin?
    * Which theory is correct (or _less_ correct)?

+ Why is the Moon important to life on Earth?
    * _Keep this for exoplanets_

-- Remember the weird moment of inertia (K) of the moon

(Paste moon score card here)

Why is it's moment of inertia close to 0.4?

**Conference on the Origin of the moon**

(Get markdown guide)

*Origin of the Earth, System Constraints*

+ Mass of the Moon
+ Earth - Moon Angular Momentum 
+ Moon Orbit Inclination


+ Lank of Volatiles
+ Oxygen isotopes 
+ etc... (Magma Ocean, Lack of Iron Core)

######Physical v Chemical

1. the Mass of the moon
Large! Almost 1% the mass of the Eart (weird)

2. Earth - Moon Angular Momentum

Angular Momentum = $mvr$

Ten times more angular momentum than expected in this system

(Surf 3)

3. THe Moon's Orbital Inclination
Natural satellites orbit directly above their planet's equator. 

The Moon is not close to the earth's equator, 5 degrees away from ecliptic, 23.5 degrees earth

#####Volatility

_A more volatile substance evaporates at a lower temperature than a less volatile (more refractory) one_

Volatile -> Refractory (less volatile)

- Alcohol -> Water
- Water -> Rock
- Rock -> Iron
- Iron -> Tungsten

(subscript and mdown)

The earth moon system lacks volatile elements, the moon has been significantly heated (molten)

Volatile to Refractory ratio decreases with introduction of heat

(Insert table here)

-- Earth lacks substantially in volatility compared to other worlds

#####Oxygen Isotopes

_The thing with the neutrons <a>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isotope</a>_

-- Isotopic ratios should be different

-> Earth-moon system have identical oxygen isotope ratios.

#####Lack of an Iron Core

    The relative size of a world's iron core to the size of the world is nearly the same for all worlds - this is not true
 for the Moon.

 The Moon's Moment of Inertia is nearly that of a uniform sphere (implying that the moon has no iron core)

 (Magma Ocean, moon was completely molten)

 The materials that make up the moon are low density materials


#####Theories:

1. Theories and hypothesis
2. Giant impact
3. Co accretion
4. Capture
5. (paste other here)

Accretion: The collisional growth of objects, small -> come together to make large objects (make simulation relative things)

Captured moon ? Fission (ternary operations)

*Giant impact theory was discussed seriously*

Made score card.... Giant Impact won

(I or F)

(paste chart here)

In summary in becomes more and more evident that the moon was the result of the collision between the Earth and another body

Even silicon isotopes are identical

(animation...)

##How to Make a Moon

Soon after differentiation slam something into the Earth (40 Myrs). The Moon coalesced out of the debris which was composed mainly of iron-poor, crustal material. This is very low probability

"The arguments against alternatives are strong"

#####Why is the Moon important?

1. Stability

    + Orbital Variations tend to be small and occur on long time scales (nearly circular, lib.t b.t)
    + Obliquity and Precession minimized by moon (office hours, homework)

2. Tides (different life is supported by tides, rem cs hw enigma machine)

    + Provoked land-formed life (YAY HUMANS)
    + Angular momentum (energy and stuffs)
