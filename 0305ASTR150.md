## How Objects in the Solar System Formed

##### Earth and moon lack the volatiles, look to Sun carbonaceous chondrites for the average

-- Nebulae are where these stars form, Giant Molecular Clouds or Stellar Nurseries (ASTR 101)

-- Nebular theory of Star formation:
    - Dense regions collapse and spin to form _disks_ of material
    - Star forms center - planets accrete with same spin

-- Where do all the heavy elements come from.? duh
    - Big Bang nucleosynthesis only includes lighter elements
    - Massive stars produce the rest
    - Supernovae produce everything after iron.
    - (That do not go gentle quote)
    - "Star stuff"
    - Hahhh nearby supernova caused molecular collapse
    - "Iron 60" can only be created in supernovae
    - Maybe other places for iron 60
    - Sun probably had many neighbors
    - Solar Nebulae were most likely short lived. Accretion ends after sun "turns on"
    - The radiation pressure would push out gas and dust

-- Actual Formation

    - Has to be built in about 10 million years
    - Where the object is formed affects what it is made of
    - Things beyond snow line are large for obvious reasons
    - Living near the sun need non-volatiles
    - Temperature increases on proximity to the sun
    - Also jupiter is huge. It has its own snow line

-- Why is Jupiter so Massive

    - 318x earth
    - Jupiter was the first gas giant formed
    - Jupiter was sitting in the sweet spot, near the largest snow line area
    - Jupiter dictates the structure of the asteroid belt
    - Responsible for cratering
    - Removed things from the asteroid belt
    - Jupiter makes comets short period
    - Achondrites were pushed to earth by jupiter
    - Jupiter is actually as large as a planet could possible get 
    - 300x Jupiter = star 
    - Weird brown dwarves
    - Need a 10 earth mass core
    - Relative density low
    - Jupiter and saturn two to one resonance, changed orbits dramatically and kicked orbits out 
    - Found super hot jupiters

-- Moving planets from exoplanets

    - Dark Jupiter may haunt the edge of the solar system. Fifth Gas Giant, Mars could've been larger
    - Water came from the outer solar system?
