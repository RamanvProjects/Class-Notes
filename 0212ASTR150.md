## Discovery of Objects

(Insert Titus Bode law here)

- The majority of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are small.
- 465 Asteroids were discovered (telescope)
- Photographic plates were invented which helped
- Max Wolf (248)

##### CCD Chip

- Ability to store and compare images
- >260,000 asteroids fount
- Asteroid thing supernova (zoo, supernova)
- We've found a ton of NEAs
- Many more small than large asteroids.
- All heavily cratered space potatoes
- Small things have a shape dictated by the strength of rock. Rock support is irregular usually. Larger than 500 km things become crushed.

##### Vesta

- Has a 200 km iron core diffrentiated. Identified gullies carved in the past by water, had mare flows, and is the last remaining rocky protoplanet that formed the terrestrial planet (the flare)
- Has quite a large number of craters, very old.
- Ceres may have active hydrological water processes leading to seasonal polar caps of water frost, altering our understanding of the interior of these bodies, etc, etc.

##### Meteorite stuffs

- Vesta - the parent body of achondrite meteorite, was geologically active, has mare on its surface
- WAS scholar thingy
- Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
- Eros, small and ittegula, looks like lunar regolith
- Full of volatices NEAR,
- This asteroid has an r plot similar to atmosphered planets. Seismic resurfacing when it gets hit by an object, covers smaller craters
- Asteroids hold the ancient history of the entire solar system
- All asteroids are pretty slowly, fall below their rotational instability limit.
- Many asteroids are not fully solid, held together by gravity, must rotate slowly or they would fly apart
- Some asteroids have satellites

##### Origin of The Asteroid Belt:

- Not the result of a huge object breaking apart.
    + We know that because of the carbonaceous chondrites with chondrules, can only come from small bodies

- All of these meteorites are chemically distinct, so they could not have been part of the same body

##### Jupiter

- Jupiter keeps it from becoming a planetJupiter is the only thing that counts for sometiing
- There is a lot of space in between asteroids. (actually a planet was just blown up)
- Average spacing is 10x the Earth moon density
- Lagrange points (higher GPA please)
- Resonances are contained in the asteroid belt because of Jupiter.
- Orbital resonance?
- Keplers third law
- Slow orbits?
- Resonances change orbits, asteroids do not like to be in resonance with juper, over time jupiters gravity will push them into different orbits
- Take physics
- Changes the shape of asteroids orbit, to cross Earth
- Vesta is pushed in 3:1 allowing for delivery of achondrites
- Cratering is mostly jupiter's fault
- Jupiter is depleting the asteroid belt
- Proximity from the sun changes asteroids, go to grading schema, get 4.000000000000000
- Snow line, happens at 3 AU Rocks and irons condense, ices stay gaseous vs Low temp, rocks, iron and ices condense, ice-rock worlds
- Ices vastly outnumber metals
