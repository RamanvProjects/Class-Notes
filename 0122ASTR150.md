##Chemistry or Life? Mars

###Discovery:

(Paste missed notes here)

+ Discovered way back when.
+ Flyby in 1965


- Possibly material found, dropped in gas chamber, fizzed. Not life -> chemicals
- Mars is dryer than we though and it has no Onze layer to protect it from the UV radiation
- Viking accused of killing martian life (non-water based)
- The Viking missions were shut down, possible contamination still possible

#####Mars Pathfinder: 1996

- Billion dollar price tag. New tech test bed, first rover (sojourner). Solar powered and well equipped
- Landed with airbags!!!
- Landed in an interesting part of Mars. Ares Vallis (looks like river delta)
- Comparison of chemical composition of rocks at Pathfinder site with Viking sites are possible.
    + They're similar. Either rocks all over Mars are the same or some global event connects them all

**Chemical Analysis Results**

- Most rocks are Andesites - igneous, volcanic rocks
- Found every surface was covered with a thick layer of dust or Martian soil - even apparently clean  areas. Drills are necessary for the future.

#####Spirit and Opportunity:

- Goal was to look for where life might have taken hold.
- How could there have been liquid water on Mars? 1/6000th the pressure and low temperature. Water sublimes
- There must have been a thicker atmosphere and warmer.
- Spirit and Opportunity were their own base stations.
- (Get a sundial)
- Brought a RAT (rock abrasion tool). Landed in Guev Crater on the border of Mare & Highlands near the equator (for awesome data)
- THought to be a Lacustrine environment (looks like a river delta with shorelines)

_Doing:_

- Drive to rims of impact craters to sample rocks.
- They found Olvine (Fe,Mg)2SiO4
- Olvine dissolves very easily in water
- Rocks in the crater are mostly mantle material - classic basalts and rich in Olivine
- Conclusion: Water could not have been present for more than ~100 yrs, too short. 

-> Lots of volcanic material, nothing biologically interesting

_Conclusion:_ Area may have been wet in the past, not now or recently

*Opportunity:*

- Landed in a little crater at the Mare Highlands border
- Had an interesting chemical signature. Hematite
- Hematite usually forms in Hot and Wet environments
- Implies warm wet water

+ Airbags again, leave impact craters
+ Doesn't seem to be any basalt in landing crater, found layered sedimentary rock.
+ Meridiani crater (is what it was called)
+ Found little blueberries called hematite.
+ Chemical analysis of rocks means that the area is rich in salts
+ Classic evaporative basin
+ Salt lake city... > < > < > <> < > <><><> >< <> >< <><>
+ Conclusion: First evidence of liquid water on Mars.

Designed to last for 30 days:

+ Spirit went to the Columbia hills. Found more blueberries. Means water. Lots of exposed rocks.
+ Goethite is a hydrated iron oxide, found there. Hot wet aqueous environments
+ May 2009: Spirit got stuck. Drove 4.8 miles... hah
+ Had to drive to bigger craters to find exposed rocks to escape miles of rolling sand craters
+ Endurance Crater: 130m. Found salts and choline and weathering, freeze thaw cycle. Lots of evidence of water

Going to -> Victoria crater:

+ About the size of Barrianger crater
+ The annulus. Looked at the rim rocks. Pretty fun
+ NO ABSOLUTE AGES??!?!?!
+ Gypsum found (CaSO4) warm wetness
+

#####Pheonic Mars Mission

+ Launch 2007
+ Land 2008
+ Used to check out the poles
+ Pheonix is disgned to stud the soil potential for suitability for life.
+ Struts hold the solar panels are covered in droplets of liquid.
+ Perchlorate is salty, vigorously reacts with water. Antifreeze
+ Biology and vim plugins for web. Chemistry but we found perchlorate
+ The brine would be very salty, not conducive to life.
+ Chlorine rich Southern Highlands
+ Water left about 3 byrs in north
+ Ice is frozen under the surface of Mars
+ Flows of briny water possible?
+ J asc
+ MRO image of opportunity. Opportunity is still there


#####Curiosity:

+ Hugely scaled up
+ Nuclear powered. Can be busy at night. UV image of Martian rock for flourescent minerals
+ Image curiosity family
+ Wasn't bounced! Landed with a sky-crane

_Landed?_

+ Gale Crater: A big complex crater with a central peak (deep ancient material)
+ Liquid water was ancient ~4-3.5 Byrs.
+ Lava flows covered most of evidence 3 Byrs
+ Mare?
+ Duststone, sulfates, clays and sulfates
+ Rocks were eroded and smoothed off
+ (B.t very soon)
+ Large impacts- Volcanism -> Nature of aqueous environments -> Valley networks -> Outflow channels
