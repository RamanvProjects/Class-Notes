## Yay Pluto (Lecture) and the Kuiper belt

##### Size:

- Dropped drastically as technology improved, a "dwarf planet." Initially considered Earth sized.
- It was possible to calculate its mass because of Sharon
- All planets are supposed to be regular satellites, with low eccentricity and not inclined to the Sun. 
- Only about ten pixels across in the Voyager missions
- Had to send a new satellite out there


##### Properties:

- Small diameter and Charon, and stuff
- Small class of objects called plutoids? Dwarf planet
- Really a bit like the Asteroid belt

##### Kuiper Belt:

- The Kuiper Belt follows the same discovery pattern as the Asteroid Belt
- (find things)
- The material here doesn't accrete simply due to its lack of speed and size, a "still forming planet"
- These objects are icy and red
- Technically in there are resonances with Neptune
- Pluto is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune
- The Pluto is a member of the Kuiper belt objects. Lots of planetesimals found pluto sized.
- UB313 was found, larger than pluto.
- ADHD submission, Game Night?
- A planet has to clear it's own space
- Short period comets and long period comets, short are all prograde, long period are mostly retrograde, mostly in the same plane of the solar system
- Comets disintegrating, creates meteor showers (volatiles)
- Comets aren't really cratered, just lose material
- Shoemaker Levy 9 impact
-
